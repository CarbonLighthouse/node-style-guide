# Carbon Lighthouse Node.js & Javascript Style Guide

This is a guide for writing consistent and aesthetically pleasing node.js & javascript code.
It is heavily plagiarized from https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide but with some significant changes.

## Formatting

### 2 Spaces for indentation

Use 2 spaces for indenting your code and swear an oath to never mix tabs and
spaces - a special kind of hell is awaiting you otherwise.

### Newlines

Use UNIX-style newlines (`\n`), and a newline character as the last character
of a file. Windows-style newlines (`\r\n`) are forbidden inside any repository.

:mega: Configure your code editor to ensure file ends with a newline on save!

### No trailing whitespace

Just like you brush your teeth after every meal, you clean up any trailing
whitespace in your JS files before committing. Otherwise the rotten smell of
careless neglect will eventually drive away contributors and/or co-workers.

:mega: Configure your code editor to strip out trailing whitespace on save!

### Use Semicolons

According to [scientific research][hnsemicolons], the usage of semicolons is
a core value of our community. Consider the points of [the opposition], but
be a traditionalist when it comes to abusing error correction mechanisms for
cheap syntactic pleasures.

### Use single quotes

Use single quotes except to avoid escaping.

*Right:*

```js
var foo = 'bar';
var species = "Grevy's Zebra";
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var foo = "bar";
```

### Opening braces go on the same line

Your opening braces go on the same line as the statement.

*Right:*

```js
if (true) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
if (true)
{
  console.log('losing');
}
```

Also, notice the use of whitespace before and after the condition statement.

### Declare one variable per var statement

Declare one variable per var statement, it makes it easier to re-order the
lines.

*Right:*

```js
var keys = ['foo', 'bar'];
var values = [23, 42];

var object = {};
while (keys.length) {
  var key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var keys = ['foo', 'bar'],
    values = [23, 42],
    object = {},
    key;

while (keys.length) {
  key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```
